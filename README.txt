TODO what happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))?
    If you only have one lin of "list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))" one instance of 77 gets removed but not
    all of them. If you put "list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))" in the while loop it runs more times than there are 77s
    and, we get an error.
